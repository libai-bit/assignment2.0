|    Hot summer nights,mid July    |
| when you and I were forever wild |

*The crazy days,city lights*
*the way you'd play with me like a child*

**will you still love me**
**when I no longer young and beautiful**
**will you still love**
**when I got nothing but my aching soul**

~~I know you will,I know you will~~

~~I know that you will~~
